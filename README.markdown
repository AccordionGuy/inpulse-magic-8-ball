This tutorial walks the reader through the process of installing the virtual machine development environment and confirming that it works. It then presents a series of tutorial exercises, starting with a "Hello, World" app and concluding with a ["Magic 8-Ball"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) app. No inPulse smartwatch is necessary; all apps are run on the inPulse simulator in the virtual machine.
