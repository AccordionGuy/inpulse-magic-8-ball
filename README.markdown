# inPulse Magic 8-Ball Tutorial

## About the Tutorial
**[inPulse Magic 8-Ball](http://accordionguy.github.com/inpulse-magic-8-ball/)** is a tutorial for programmers who are new to programming apps for the [inPulse smartwatch](http://getinpulse.com/). This tutorial walks the reader through the process of installing the virtual machine development environment and confirming that it works. It then presents a series of tutorial exercises, starting with a "Hello, World" app and concluding with a ["Magic 8-Ball"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) app. No inPulse smartwatch is necessary; all apps are run on the inPulse simulator in the virtual machine.
